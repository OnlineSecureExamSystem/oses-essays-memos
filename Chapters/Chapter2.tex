    \raggedright\section{Introduction}
    In the development process the conception phase is an essential part since it provides a representation of the structure of the system in a static way (domain model).
    The purpose of this chapter is to examine the conceptual part of our system, We first define the entities in the system, based on that, we construct the domain class diagram where we define the relationships between entities, where we describe the attributes, the operations and their visibility for each entity, and finally we conclude with a conclusion.

        \raggedright\section{Domain Model}
        The domain model is a visual representation of real world entities and the relationships between them, which collectively describe the problem domain space, It's used to clarify important domain-specific terms and to identify the entity classes.
        \raggedright\subsection{Entities}
        A list of all entities and brief description for each one specifying the role of that entity\linebreak \\
